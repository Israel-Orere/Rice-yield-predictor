# Rice-yield-predictor
This notebook predicts rice yield from satellite images
Polarisation Signals and their derivatives are derived  from the satelite data like vv, vh, rvi etc
The way these signals vary over time can provide information on the health and status of the crops and soil from moisture content to chlorophyll
For Nigeria, rice yield data is readily available for many rice plantations. Satellite data can be gotten from Microsoft's planetary hub.
